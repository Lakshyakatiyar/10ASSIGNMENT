    "3.In Bernoulli Naive Bayes, if a feature (word or term) is missing in a given document, it is typically treated as if the term is absent (0). The classifier does not explicitly handle missing values; instead, it assumes that if a feature is not present, its value is 0. This simplifies the handling of missing features as no additional imputation or special treatment is needed."

    "4.Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification. Gaussian Naive Bayes models the distribution of continuous features using a Gaussian (normal) distribution and can be applied to classify instances into multiple classes. In multi-class classification, the algorithm calculates the posterior probability for each class and assigns the instance to the class with the highest posterior probability. The steps involve:\n",
